MUD Controller

Overview

This project is a simple MUD Controller, designed to handle player commands and interactions within a text-based dungeon environment. The game allows players to explore rooms, pick up items, and navigate the dungeon using simple commands.

Command Parsing: Reads user input, identifies the main command, and extracts arguments.

Room Navigation: Allows the player to move forward, back, left, and right if a room exists in that direction.

Item Interaction: Enables the player to pick up items from the room and add them to their inventory.

Game Loop: Runs a continuous loop to process player commands until they choose to exit.

Help & Exit Commands: Displays available commands and allows users to quit the game.

Error Handling: Provides appropriate messages for invalid commands or unavailable actions.

look â€“ Describe the current room.
move <forward|back|left|right> â€“ Move in a specified direction.
pick up <itemName> â€“ Pick up an item from the room.
inventory â€“ Show the player's inventory.
